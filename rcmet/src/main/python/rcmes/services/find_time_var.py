"""
    Small command line utility to find what the time variable is called in a model file.
    
    Background::  
        Model output files tend not to follow any defined standard in terms of 
        variable naming conventions.  One model may call the time "time", 
        another one may call it "t".  This script looks for the existence of 
        any of a predefined list of synonyms for time.
    
    This script should be run from the command line (i.e. not called from within python)
    
    Input::
        -filename
    
    Output::
        -success flag (1 or 0): were both latitude and longitude variable names found in the file?
        
        if successful:
            -name of time variable
            -(TODO) modelStartTime -descriptions of time ranges in data files
            -(TODO) modelEndTime
        if unsuccessful:
            -list of variable names in file
    
    (NB. all printed to standar output)
