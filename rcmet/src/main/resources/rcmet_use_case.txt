Regional Climate Modeling Evaluation Toolkit Use Case

User = Scientist
System = RCMES

Goal:  Compute Metrics on a Local Climate Model
Main Success Scenario
1.  User logs into System
2.  User selects a model file
3.  User selects model latitude, longitude, time and parameter
4.  User selects observation datasets and parameters
5.  System returns the time range information where Obs and Model
parameters overlap.
6.  User selects time range.
7.  System returns VALID re-gridding options for Space and Time.  
(VALID meaning smaller grid to a larger grid step)
8.  User selects the re-gridding options
9.  Optional Processing (SEE OPEN ISSUES SECTION)


Extensions:
1a:  User has no account setup
	.1:  User will create an account
	.2:  System will create an upload directory for the account
	and email instructions about how to FTP the model files into
	the new directory
	Main Success Scenario Step 1

2a:  User has no models in the System to choose
	.1:  User will FTP their model file(s) into their upload directory
	Main Success Scenario Step 2

# This could be prevented if Step 4 ONLY returns Datasets with a proper
#  temporal overlap.  This might be an enhancement in the future.
5a:  The Model and Observational Datasets don't have a time overlap
	.1:  System will return a message explaining the lack of overlap
	Main Success Scenario Step 4


OPEN QUESTIONS/ISSUES

***Optional Processing***
Masked Region:  Does this work today?
Seasonal Cycles:  Does this option work?

User will select the Metric they want to compute.  [Should we consider limiting
this list based on what is being selected in the model and observations]
Metrics:
-Bias: mean bias across full time range
-Mean Absolute Error: across full time range  
-Difference: calculated at each time unit
-Anomaly Correlation
-Pattern Correlation
*Probability Distribution Function similarity score
-Root Mean Square Error

Customize Plots:  Does this work today?
