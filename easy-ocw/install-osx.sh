Easy OCW assists with the building of the Apache Open Climate Workbench and its dependencies

Flags:
    -h  Display this help message.
    -e  Install and configure a virtualenv environment before installation.
    -q  Quiet install. User prompts are removed (when possible).

It is recommended that you pass -e when running this script. If you don't, parts
of this installation will pollute your global Python install. If you're unsure,
pass -e just to be safe!

A number of dependencies for OCW will now be installed. Please check the wiki
for a complete list of dependencies. Additionally, please read the wiki for
useful installation guidelines and information that may be pertinent to your
situation. All of this can be found at http://s.apache.org/3p2

It is highly recommended that you allow Easy OCW to install the dependencies
into a virtualenv environment to ensure that your global Python install is
not affected. If you're UNSURE, you should pass the -e flag
to this script. If you aren't concerned, or you want to create your own
virtualenv environment, then feel free to ignore this message.

If you are familiar with virtualenv you should know that activating
the new 'ocw' environment is different because we use conda to install
packages.  An example of the command you want to run is listed in the
alias below.

To make it easier to change into the 'ocw' virtualenv add the
following alias to your ~/.bash_profile

    alias ocw='source $ocw_path/ocw/bin/activate ~/ocw/'

When you want to use ocw in the future, you just have to type 'ocw'
in your terminal."
else
    echo "***POST INSTALLATION NOTE***

If you have run this script within your own virtualenv you need to know
a couple of caveats/side effects that are caused by using conda to install
packages within the virtualenv.

- Virtualenv wrapper will throw errors like those outlined here:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CLIMATE-451

- You will not be able to 'activate' the environment using the normal
virtualenv command, you must instead use the conda activate command as follows:

source path/to/your_env/bin/activate path/to/your_env

Example:  (assuming your env is in ~/.virtualenv/ocw)

source ~/.virtualenv/ocw/bin/activate ~/.virtualenv/ocw
