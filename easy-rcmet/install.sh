Easy OCW assists with the building of the Apache Open Climate Workbench and its dependencies

Flags:
    -h  Display this help message.
    -e  Install and configure a virtualenv environment before installation.
    -q  Quiet install. User prompts are removed (when possible).

It is recommended that you pass -e when running this script. If you don't, parts
of this installation will pollute your global Python install. If you're unsure,
pass -e just to be safe!

It is highly recommended that you allow this script to install and configure a
virtualenv environment for you. If you passed the -e flag when running
this script you're fine! Otherwise, know what you're doing! Parts of this
script will pollute your global Python install if you don't run within a
virtualenv environment. If you already have a virtualenv environment into which
you want installs to go then make sure you don't pass -e!

If this installed virtualenv for you, make sure you set the following values in
your shell's RC file.

    export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs
    source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh

Similarly, the default virtualenv environment that this script creates for you
to use during OCW work is called "ocw". Whenever you want to work on OCW
tasks be sure to run

    workon ocw

This will activate the OCW environment. When you're done, run

    deactivate ocw

If you would like to read more about how to use virtualenv and 
virtualenvwrapper please look to the following websites for documentation.

    http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/
    http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

Additonally, you should set your PYTHONPATH environment variable to point to the
OCW code base that was downloaded into ./src/ocw For example:
    
    export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/this/script/src/ocw:$PYTHONPATH
