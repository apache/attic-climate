### Dr. Duane Waliser

####Role: Principal Investigator

Dr. Duane Waliser is Chief Scientist, Earth Science and Technology Directorate, a Visiting Associate in the Geological and Planetary Sciences Division at Caltech and an Adjunct Professor in the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences Department at UCLA. His principle research interests lie in climate dynamics and in global atmosphere-ocean modeling, with emphasis on prediction and predictability, and model evaluation and improvement. He joined JPL in 2004 with interests in utilizing new and emerging satellite data sets to study weather and climate as well as advance our model simulation and forecast capabilities, particularly for long-range weather and short-term climate applications.

### Dr. Chris Mattmann

#### Role: Data System Lead

Dr. Chris Mattmann is the Data System Lead for the Regional Climate Model Evaluation System and leads the team of developers building the data system for Dr. Duane Waliser. Mattmann is a Co-I on a Winning NASA National Climate Assessment Proposal to construct the RCMES and to use in regional model comparisions with satellite remote sensing data, for NARCCAP and for the broader community including CORDEX. Mattmann has a Ph.D. in Computer Science from USC, and has worked at JPL for 11 years.
