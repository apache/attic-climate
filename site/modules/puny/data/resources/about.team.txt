### Kim Whitehall

#### Role: RCMES Researcher, Ph.D Student, Howard University
####Email: [kim.d.whitehall@jpl.nasa.gov](mailto:kim.d.whitehall@jpl.nasa.gov)


Kim Whitehall is a PhD student in the Howard University Program in  Atmospheric Sciences (HUPAS), Washington, D.C. and is working with [Dr. Gregory S. Jenkins](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hurricanes/bios/jenkins_bio.html). Her main research interests reside in tropical climate dynamics, and the weather and climate modeling of that region. Prior to pursuing her PhD, she worked 4 years as a climatologist in the Caribbean. During that time, she developed technical skills with regards to using, manipulating, and evaluating climate and weather model datasets, but also developed an understanding of the impacts and concerns with regards to climate dynamics on societies and economies in the tropics.
