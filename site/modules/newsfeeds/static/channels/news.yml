# WRM Regional Climate Model Evaluation Database YML Newsfeed. 
#
# HTML is acceptable within an article body. To take advantage of YAML line-folding
# for the article body, place a single pipe (|) on the line with the body key, and 
# begin your article text on the following line, with the appropriate indentation.
# All subsequent lines should be similarly indented. 
#
# Note: when starting a new article, the leading dash ('-') is important
# as it indicates to the YAML parser that what follows should be added to the 
# array of entries. Also, YAML uses whitespace to denote hierarchy. Therefore,
# indentation matters -- use spaces, never tabs.
#
# Also Note: For now, sorting is left up to you. However articles are sorted in this
# file will be the order they are displayed in the feed. To make newer entries appear
# on top, simply place them above the entries that already exist here.

    <p>The database crossed the 5 billion data points mark this morning and is
    still going strong! 
    <p>ERA-Interim, the latest <a href="http://www.ecmwf.int/">ECMWF</a>
    global atmospheric reanalysis of the period 1989 to present, is currently 
    being ingested into the database and will be available for querying soon. 
    This dataset contains both surface and atmospheric components. At the moment,
    surface data only are being added, but atmospheric data will be following
    shortly. More information on the ERA-Interim dataset is available
    <a href="http://www.ecmwf.int/research/era/do/get/index">here</a>.

    <p>A recently ingested products module was added to the WRM website. Users of the
    regional climate modeling and evaluation system can now see in real time when the
    page loads what products are being ingested into the WRM database.

    <p>News feeds have been added to the WRM website. 
    Check this area frequently for status updates and other announcements regarding 
    the ongoing development of the regional climate model evaluation database
    
    <p>After a minor setback last week in which a bug was discovered in the way
    dates are being processed, the database is again growing at speed. Meanwhile
    investigation continues into alternative back-end methods for acheiving the 
    desired levels of scalability this project will eventually demand.
