Release Notes - RCMES Project - Version 1.1.0 - 08/09/2012

** The project has been renamed from Water Resource Management to Regional Climate Model Evaluation System


** Bug
    * [RCMES-59] - Drop Down Menu Lists are Broken @ http://rcmes.jpl.nasa.gov/
	* [RCMES-58] - set group ownership to 'daemon' for rcmes puny content
 	* [RCMES-46] - wrm_merra_slp - Database is being written to extremely slowly
 	* [RCMES-10] - Fix the MySQL/PHP Timeout for Database Query Web Service
 	* [RCMES-8] - AIRSL3NetCDF extractor should not extract 'data points' for parameter definitions
 	* [RCMES-7] - Granule Segments coming into the Catalog are being counted as new Granules
 	* [RCMES-6] - Update the Query API page to include datasetId
 	* [RCMES-4] - Catalog needs to insert the variable name into shortName instead of longName (parameter TABLE)
 	* [RCMES-3] - Granule Segments coming into the Catalog are being counted as new Datasets
 	* [RCMES-1] - ISO timestamp support in WRM means we need to change the TYPE of all time columns to VARCHAR20


** Improvement
    * [RCMES-42] - Rebrand SVN home for RCMES away from WRM

 	* [RCMES-48] - Create 10 more Databases
 	* [RCMES-44] - Create A set of Databases for the MERRA dataset
 	* [RCMES-28] - Schema and supporting doc. checked into SVN
 	* [RCMES-26] - File Manager Policy checked into SVN

 	* [RCMES-20] - Update - Python GRIB Extractor to read all variables in a file
 	* [RCMES-18] - Enable GRIB Extractor to take in Command Line Arguments
 	* [RCMES-17] - Set up basic website that provides information about the contents of the WRM databse
 	* [RCMES-16] - Develop metadata extractor for sample data
